# Heavy-ion collisions on the OSG -- heavy quark sector

Workflow for running e-b-e heavy-ion collsion simulation and heavy quark transport model pn the OpenScienceGrid(OSG). This one is used for analysis diffusion-coefficients as correlated to temperature and momentum by Bayesian comparison.

Most of the workflow are inherited from works done by Jonah Bernhard heavy-ion collision simulations (https://github.com/jbernhard/heavy-ion-collisions-osg). And the library for heavy quark diffusion process is provided by Shanshan Cao.
